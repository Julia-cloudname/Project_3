# **Calorie Calculator**
## **Overview**

Calorie Calculator is a console application for calculating daily calorie requirements based on height, weight, gender, and physical activity. In this application, the user inputs the required data, and based on that, the program calculates the basal metabolic rate (BMR). This is the minimum number of calories required by our body to perform basic functions such as breathing, blood circulation, and cell production while at rest. In other words, it is the amount of energy our body needs to continue functioning while doing nothing.

Additionally, the user can receive recommendations on how many calories they should consume per day to achieve their goal, whether it is to lose, gain, or maintain weight.

To calculate the basal metabolic rate, the Harris-Benedict formula is used, based on total body mass, height, age, and gender. The application uses recommendations from The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for weight loss and weight gain to calculate daily calorie requirements.

The application is created in Python and uses functions, loops, and conditional statements to calculate the result.
